  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>
    It has always been about the games. Playing games. Creating games.
  </p>
  <p>
    At age 9 I made quiz booklets and convoluted mazes for my friends and family to solve.
  </p>
  <p>
    At 13, I discovered how computers let me create far more interesting games.
  </p>
  <p>
    At 19, I reached an incredible milestone: I was <a href="http://playonic.dk">self employed</a> and could work on games full time. I felt very privileged â€“ and still do.
  </p>
  <p>
    My passion for games has led me to self-study a lot of game related topics:
    Drawing, graphical design, writing, music, story telling, game design, programming, marketing, database theory, mathematics.
    I also love physics and astronomy.

  <p>
    This year, I'll begin a new chapter in my life and I can't wait to tell the world about it :-)
