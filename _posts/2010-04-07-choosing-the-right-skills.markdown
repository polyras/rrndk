People who are good at creating software often share one thing: fueled by passion they constantly strive to become better at what they do. As times go by, they get increasingly more skilled in their field.

However, when looking for which skills to aquire, I think many of us do a pretty bad job. In order to be truly extraordinary at creating software, it is not enough just to be skilled. You must be skilled in the right areas.

Programmers who focus *only* on improving their programming skill, become better programmers. People who focus on improving skills directly related to creating better user experiences, become better at creating software. You become what you learn.

I myself was a hardcore programmer once. But over the years I've learned this valuable lesson: if I want to create awesome software I must stop looking at myself as a programmer, but instead as a software creator. This makes me focus on learning skills that matters the most.
