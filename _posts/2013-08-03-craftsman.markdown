Dear Conscience,

Since I [left my job at Playonic](http://rrn.dk/moving-on) you've been nagging me. Like a dark rain-filled cloud you've been making my head heavier. And I know, I know â€“ you're right! I need to create a new source of income before my savings run out. And Conscience, we both know about our dream: Together we'll start a new indie game company and make it financially sustainable.

The wise way to do it
------------------

And you know, I have a pretty good idea of how we can accomplish this. I think any wise entrepreneurs would take a deep look at the industry, identify opportunities, and locate the shortest paths to profitability. They'd recognise the cynicism required to keep afloat in the competitive industry of gaming and go for it hammer and tongs!

As a one man army company I should be learning how to use the popular and productive game engines like Unity and Game Maker. They reduce development time and makes you more agile in a vibrant market. I should be planning a viral strategy and devising the right monetization scheme. By now, I should've produced at least 4 prototypes in order to discover that magic game idea that'd eventually make everything come together. And in the process I should have neglected code quality altogether. Clever/nasty hacks are an essential way to speed up development.

Conscience, I can see you're excited about this - but I'm afraid I got some bad news for you.

The fun way to do it
-----------------

I haven't done any of this. Instead, I've been learning the ancient, cumbersome languages that is C and C++ and in awe contemplated its simplicity, fundamental nature, and immense power. Reading about CPU architectures left me astounded and hungry for more. With glowing eyes I've studied the OpenGL pipeline - its simplicity, flexibility, and elegance. And with it, I rediscovered linear algebra and how matrix maths enchant graphics software. It was beautiful and lit a fire in my belly.

When I finally started working on a prototype my attention quickly drifted as I discovered I didn't know enough about game AI design to continue without resorting to nasty hacks, algorithms I didn't understand, or just plain bad solutions. So once more I decided to take the longer route by reading books about game AI, yet again neglecting our race against time.

Conscience, you'd probably say I've taken the more difficult route for no apparent reason.

But there is a reason
------------------

But dear Conscience, I *have* a good reason! I've been taking the painstaking route because I care. I care so much about this I'm willing to pay the price of lowering my odds at succeeding as an indie game developer. I crave the feeling of doings things right, of understanding why and how things work like they do. Of producing something truly great to be proud of.

And I'm not only talking about technicalities. The same level of enthusiasm matters in the storytelling, the visuals, the mechanics, the writing, the music, the vibe, mood, and atmosphere, and basically the entire experience of a game.

Steve Jobs told [the story](http://thenextweb.com/apple/2011/10/24/steve-jobs-obsession-with-the-quality-of-the-things-unseen/) of his father who refused to use poor wood for the back of the cabinets he was building even though nobody ever saw it. The fact that everything including the hidden parts was properly made, was what made the overall product great. That resonated deeply with me.

Richard Feynman said:

> What I cannot build, I cannot understand.

Building something is the best way to make sure you've actually understood something.

What's the point anyway?
---------------------

I know this sound like gibberish to you, Conscience. Ironically, my love for the craft and quality of my work might be the very thing that makes it impossible for me to earn a living by making games. A would-be perfect game that is never completed because I'm to proud to do anything less than "properly" isn't really worth anything, I know! You have to make compromises and I definitely regard that as one of my biggest personal challenges.

But I believe that my thorough approach to things will pay off in the long run. I'm not sure the payoff will come soon enough to let my indie game dream survive. At least not this time around. But that doesn't matter. Even if I do crash and burn with my modest savings it'll all be worth it. At the moment, I'm having the time of my life educating myself, exploring, fooling around, and feeling the satisfying sensation of growing as a person. It's absolutely great. And isn't that what life is about? Having fun and enjoying it? And even if I fall, I'll find a way to get on my feet again.

As W. Clement Stone said:

> Try, try, try, and keep on trying is the rule that must be followed to become an expert in anything.

So Conscience, I've decided to stop listening to you (at least not every day anyway). And don't worry, I'll be fine. Because in the end, at heart, I'm neither a business man nor an entrepreneur. I'm more like an artist, a musician, or a carpenter. I'm a craftsman!
