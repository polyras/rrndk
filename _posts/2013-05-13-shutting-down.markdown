1.5 years ago, I discovred lump in throat.

I decided to shut down on my personal projects.

Prioritrized and started cutting.

Then I realized, why stop there?

Cut everything.

Stopped in the band. Sold my fitness stocks. De sagde det var en moden beslutning og at de fleste i min alder bare ville køre på.

Final item, stopping in company is now done.

I'm free. Feels great. I can do what I want. Wow!
