As you might know, [I resigned from Playonic](/moving-on) a couple of months ago. I was inspired by [Derek Sivers](http://sivers.org/)' idea about "[resetting your internal operating system](http://sivers.org/os)". Before taking on new projects, you got to thoroughly clear your head. Otherwise you'll be making the same thing as before with a different label.

I figured the best was to do a brain reset was to get away from home. To go somewhere different where your norms and beliefs are challenged. After skyping with my friend Morten, I booked a one-way ticket to visit him in Hong Kong. I'd never been to Asia before and considering the cultural differences (compared to going to the US for instance) this was a great fit. Without making any precise plans we talked about visiting China, Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand together.

Hong Kong
---------

It didn't start that well. The Hong Kong Observatory issued a black thunderstorm warning for the first time in several years just as we were about to land. Lots of turbulence! Let's just say I learnt that airsickness bags eventually soak through.

But I was really impressed with Hong Kong. Due to the British colonial establishment (lifted in 1997) and its geographical location in the middle of Asia, the city is a clash of cultures. I've never visited a place with this much cultural, ethnic and religious diversity.

I was happily surprised that Hong Kong isn't all banks and skyscrapers.

While standing in the middle of hundreds of skyscrapers you're only a 20 minute bus ride away from several beautiful and peaceful beaches.

Guilin, China
-----------

After spending 6-7 days in Hong Kong we went to [beautiful](http://www.google.dk/search?q=guilin&tbm=isch) Guilin by train (through Shenzhen). Due to the surprisingly bureaucratic and slow process of getting a Chinese visa, we only had one full day here. But we were lucky and got on a full day country side tour. From a small boat we observed this breathtaking scenery. So peaceful.

It was surprisingly easy getting by in China. Quite a few spoke a little English (even though we had to utilise the international body language a few times) and inside the city there were some English signposts.

Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam
-------------------

From China we flew to Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam. First thing here to make an impression was the crazy traffic. 90% rode scooters instead of driving cars. There were hardly any traffic lights. It was like an ant colony - except each ant was moving with an kinetic force of 150 kg times 50 km/h. But overall it worked surprisingly well. Couldn't help thinking how inefficient traffic at home is compared to this system.

[![Ho Chi Minh scooters](/assets/images/asia/scooters-everywhere.jpg)](/assets/images/asia/scooters-everywhere.jpg "Scooters everywhere!")

We read about Vietnam and went to a museum about the war. Learning about a country's history and culture becomes so much more interesting and impactful when you're actually there.

I noticed local restaurants (outside the city) often had no prices on their menu cards. When you asked for the price, they gave you a scrutinising glance while figuring out a number. Having no prices on your menu cards is a convient way to over-charge "rich" western customers.

Phnom Penh, Cambodia
--------------------

From here we travelled by bus towards Phnom Penh, Cambodia. Generally, travelling by land instead of flying is much more interesting. And cheap - I think the fare was around 8 dollars or so.

[![Waiting for the bus](/assets/images/asia/bus.jpg)](/assets/images/asia/bus.jpg "Our bus burst a tire.")

In Phnom Penh we visited some beautiful pagodas (I'm  embarrassed to admit I didn't know this word), a so-called [killing field](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_Fields) and a torture prison from the [Khmer Rouge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khmer_Rouge) era. I didn't know about the dreadful [Cambodian genocide](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khmer_Rouge_rule_of_Cambodia) (2 million people were systematically killed) so learning about it while being in the country and visiting an actual [killing field](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_Fields) really had a deep impact on me. It is experiences like that that really widens your perspective of life and the world.

[![Pagoda](/assets/images/asia/pagoda.jpg)](/assets/images/asia/pagoda.jpg "These pagodas were really impressive.")

Siem Reap, Cambodia
-------------------

By bus we got to Siem Reap, a smaller city that is famous for its enormous "temple city", [Angkor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angkor) (center of the former great Khmer Empire).

[![Angkor temple](/assets/images/asia/temple.jpg)](/assets/images/asia/temple.jpg "I feel this shot somehow captures the vibe I experienced at Angkor.")

The temples are as awe inspiring as they are beautiful. The surrounding forests complete the experience.

[![Angkor Wat](/assets/images/asia/angkor-wat.jpg)](/assets/images/asia/angkor-wat.jpg "Angkor Wat, the biggest temple of them all.")

We also went to see the  floating village (looks funny on [Google Maps](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=siem+reap&hl=da&ll=13.224969,103.830113&spn=0.019134,0.018303&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=62.572465,74.970703&t=h&hnear=Siem+Reap,+Cambodja&z=16)) - an entire village located on Tonle Sap Lake. It got churches and everything!

Phuket and Phi Phi, Thailand
------------------------

Originally, we had planned going to Bangkok after this. But I didn't feel like going to another big city. After visiting so many places in a short time I wanted to go somewhere tranquil where I could kick back and relax. I wanted to go to Bali but it was surprisingly expensive, so I chose Phuket, Thailand, instead. Morten went back home to Hong Kong at this point.

See, that's one of the great things of not arranging everything on beforehand. You can change plans as you desire.

[![Maya beach](/assets/images/asia/maya-beach.jpg)](/assets/images/asia/maya-beach.jpg "Maya Beach. This was where they shot the movie, The Beach.")

Karon Beach (Phuket), although touristy, was a lovely relaxing place. It was low season so hotels were cheap (50$ per night). Besides a few short showers the weather was great. Here, I confirmed a suspicion I brought from home: vacationing alone is absolutely fantastic. At least for me.

[![Having a beer, Phi Phi](/assets/images/asia/beer.jpg)](/assets/images/asia/beer.jpg "Having a beer, Phi Phi.")

Besides spending one day going to Phi Phi and talking with a few lovely strangers, I spent all my time immersing myself in the books I'd brought (Painters and Hackers, Animal Farm, and A Briefer History of Time). I read more in 4 days than I usual do in two months. And when not reading, I was left with my own thoughts: pure self-reflection. Sitting alone in a caf√© enjoying an espresso 14.000 km from home is really something.

[![Espresso](/assets/images/asia/book.jpg)](/assets/images/asia/book.jpg "Lovely book by the way. You should read it.")

All introverts should go somewhere unaccustomed and spend some time by themselves.

Eye-opening
-----------

Now, I cannot talk for other countries. But I think we Danes have a bad tendency to think too much of ourselves. Yes, we had an exemplary economy and we did win the European Football Championship - but that was in 1992!

This trip certainly solidified my suspicion that Denmark isn't as fantastic as we tend to fool ourselves into believing.

Travelling teaches you humility and widens your perspective. The "weirder" the countries, the better. Make a conscious effort to challenge yourself and your norms.

Note to self
----------

Not knowing where you'll go or sleep tomorrow often makes for an exciting journey. But it is also hectic and stressful. Next time I might choose a location or two and then stay there for a longer time instead of just rushing through new cities and friendships. That'll make it possible to form real friendships and get a better sense of the local everyday life.

So, now what?
------------

This trip has been a great break from work for me. My operating system has been reset. I've thought through what kind of company I want to create next and it feels good. I'm eager to get to work! Perhaps I'll write about that in another blog post :)
