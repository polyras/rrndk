I've decided to resign from [Playonic](http://playonic.dk). The company and [Virtual Manager](http://www.virtualmanager.com) will march on - but without me at the helm.

It's incredibly sad to say goodbye to your "baby" after almost a decade of hard work and great experiences. There have been defeats and victories. Both for me personally, but also for the game and the company as a whole.

When I started Virtual Manager while still in school, I didn't do it to make money or to get a lot of users. I did it because nobody had made the game I wanted to play.

Working on your own favorite game was [the best thing in the world](/loving-your-job). As years passed, my enthusiasm for [Virtual Manager](http://www.virtualmanager.com) has naturally faded a little. I still enjoy working on the game but I miss the euphoria of working on something you feel is the greatest thing in the world.

And that's why I've decided to "start over": I want to work on a game I feel is no less than fantastic. Not only because this is the most fun way to work, but also because that philosophy tends to breed the best products.

Leaving your safe profitable harbour is scary. And just because I've been lucky/talented enough to make "a hit product" once doesn't change the fact that succeeding in the game business is very difficult.

But [risk](/taking-risks) is part of the package. The potential rewards make up for it!

I haven't yet decided what's next, but I'll [keep](http://www.facebook.com/rasmus) [you](http://twitter.com/rasmusrn) [updated](/email_subscriptions) :)
