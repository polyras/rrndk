A couple of weeks ago I wrote about <a href="/holy-hour-and-planning-fragmentation">Holy hour and planning defragmentation</a>. Taking time to plan your week is a great idea, but for this to work it is important to have clearly defined goals. Without a goal, how do you know in which direction you should go?<br><br>To most people this is common sense. Settings goals has a positive effect on our achievements. However, when talking about goals there is one thing most of us subconsciously tend to forget or neglect: continuously reviewing our goals. The environment and people around changes rapidly, and it is our job to adjust our goals to reflect these changes. This is almost as important as setting up the goals in the first place - yet, most of us are very bad at this.<br><br>Occasionally I find myself going in one direction in my life and suddenly realizes that I'm straying away from my desired plan. Not moving towards your goals, leads to random actions, which leads to bad results both in personal business life. So does following goals that is not aligned with the current state of the world.<br><br>Just to be clear I'm not saying that you should not make long term goals, you should! But setting the goals in itself is not what drive you towards a better life. This is done by taking goal orientated actions, and this is done most optimally by being 110% aware of your goal and by having the right goals. <br><br>My point is this: continuously reviewing your goals is just as important as setting them in order to lead an intentional life. Know what your goals are and don't make the mistake of not making sure that they are reflecting dreams and your surroundings. Write down your goals and review these weekly, or better yet daily! Write down your goals and put them on your fridge or on your computer desktop where you will see them every day. In this way you'll constantly be reminded where you are supposed to be headed. This leads to better decisions which leads to reaching your goals faster.<br><br>Reviewing your goals is easy, the hard part is not forgetting to do it. So make sure you don't!
