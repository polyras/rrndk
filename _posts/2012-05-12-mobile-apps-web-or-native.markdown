During the last 5-10 years we've seen a lot of successful web apps outmatch their native counterparts.

That means web is better than native, right? Let's build our upcoming mobile app using HTML5!

No!

Web apps did not get popular because they were web based. They did so because they were great products.

Now honestly, would you rather use a native mobile app or a web based one?

So would your customer.
