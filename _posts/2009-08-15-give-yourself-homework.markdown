I love to read and learn. Feeling better than yesterday is an incredibly satisfying feeling for me. However, there are some periods where my reading gets into slow motion. Days can go by, and suddenly I realize I haven't touched my current book for a week. Sound familiar? I'd like to share a simple yet efficient idea on how to avoid this from happening.

A great way to reach a goal, is to setup very easy objectives. If your goal is to run a marathon, you set up objectives stating how fast and at what dates you should be able to run for instance 10, 20, and 25 kilometers. You're essentially breaking down the overall goal into objectives. Focusing on these easier objectives keeps you motivated to reach your end goal.

The same idea can be applied to book reading. Break down the overall goal (finish reading a book) into smaller objectives: finish chapters or pages at specific dates. These objective should be clearly stated like this:

* Get to page 67 by the 5th of August
* Get to page 80 by the 10th of August
* Get to page 100 by the 19 of August
* Etc.

The number of objectives on the list is up to you. Putting your objectives into your schedule along with your everyday tasks, allow you to dedicate more reading time at days where you have more spare time.

Tasks that are scheduled has a much higher probability of actually being done than tasks that are not. So if you like me love and/or understand the significance of learning, you might want to be giving yourself some homework to enhance your learning.
