A lot of our hardcore users at [Virtual Manager](http://www.virtualmanager.com/) can't understand why we often are reluctant to implement the most requested features. To them, it seems crystal clear that we should do whatever the majority wants us to do.

I believe we would end up with a bad or mediocre game if we blindly implemented the requests of the majority. Not because our users are stupid, but because they are not game developers. They haven't studied or practiced game development, so how could they be?

On top of this, they are emotionally biased and thus not suited for making rational decisions.

I'm not saying we should not listen to our users. I'm just saying we should focus on their problems and needs rather than their ideas and suggestions.

Personally, I'd rather play a game that was made by one great designer, than by 50.000 gamers.

It is naÃ¯ve to think you know how to design games just because you play games! That is like saying you can design and create a car, just because you can drive one.

On the topic of cars, this [Henry Ford](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Ford) quote feels appropriate:

> If I'd asked customers what they wanted, they would have said "a faster horse".
