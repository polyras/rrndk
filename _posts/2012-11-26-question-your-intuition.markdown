Human intuition is amazing. Although we often aren't aware of it, we use it all the time.

*Tihs is nnoesnse, but tahkns to yuor itniuiton it's raeadlbe.*

The crazy thing is you probably didn't actively "think" to understand that text - you just did!

As Wikipedia puts it:

> Intuition is the ability to acquire knowledge without inference and/or the use of reason.

Because it is so natural to us and happens so fast, we barely even notice it consciously. It's magic! From an evolutionary perspective, this makes a lot of sense. Imagine if we had to logically analyse all everyday problems in great scrutiny before being able to react. We wouldn't even be able to carry out a conversation without lengthy thinking pauses.

Generally, this ability is great for us.

However, intuition can also be deceptive. Its ridiculously high processing speed comes with the cost of lower accuracy (compared to conscious reasoning). And for certain problems, quality is more important than speed.

But because we're hardwired to always exploit this mechanism, it takes an extreme effort not to. We cannot turn it off, but we can choose to ignore it (at least to some extend).

So acknowledging you don't control your intuition and that your intuition may not be helpful for certain tasks leads to improved thinking.

One such task is brainstorming.

When brainstorming new designs I try to jot down ideas as fast as my brain produces them. From somewhere in the back of my brain I "hear" someone shouting "This is a bad idea, why bother writing it down?" The natural thing to do is to dismiss the idea before it reach the paper.

But recall how inaccurate these advice are. Your intuition is often right - but not always. So I try to ignore the voice, and write the bad ideas down anyway.

And every now and then something extraordinary happens: What initially looked like a bad idea end up transforming the product for the better.

And not only that, it makes me realize my intuition was very wrong. Such insights are extremely valuable because they improve our intuition. Thus, a disciplined and conscious use of this technique can have an ever self-reinforcing effect on our mental capabilities.

The peculiar thing is that we're hardwired not to question our intuition - and that's why it is extra important to think about it consciously. Question your intuition on a regular basis to improve it. It is neither pleasant, intuitive nor easy, but it's worth it :-)
