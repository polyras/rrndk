For my 23rd birthday a couple of weeks ago I got a little painting from my mother. It depicted a smiling doodle boy with the text "if you can dream it, you can do it".

It is these acts that significantly optimizes the actual probability they will actually get what they want. Put in another way, the more you believe in your wildest dreams, the higher becomes the likelihood that they will actually come true!<br><br>This is a simple yet extremely powerful idea. However, most of us fail to consider this fact often enough. For this reason, I've written this post as an reminder for you and myself.<br><br>Do you want to become a professional web designer? Do you want to start your own company? Do you want to be a programmer guru? Then believe you will! When you start to believe you will automatically start to act. And when you start to act your dreams will only come closer and closer...
