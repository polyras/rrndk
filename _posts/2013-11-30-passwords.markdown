Adobe was hacked a couple of months ago. They said information of 2.9 million accounts was stolen. A month later, [it's reported](http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/11/07/us-adobe-cyberattack-idUSBRE9A61D220131107) that the actual number was 152 million. Also, the stolen information has been published online. Ouch!

And so what if my Adobe account was hacked? I haven't used it for years. The real problem arises if you've used the same email/password combination on other sites. Hackers can use the published credentials to access these other accounts. I know I should use different passwords for each account - but who remembers 27 different passwords?

I quickly secured the concerned accounts (those I could remember) so I should be safe. However, hackers could theoretically have overtaken these accounts before I got to react.

Changing passwords is only a temporary solution though. Such security breaches will happen again. I thought about how to solve this permanently and came up with a silly simple but elegant solution.

First you choose a short sentence that is easy to remember. For instance "I like hotdogs". Your password for, say Facebook, can then be constructed like this:

1. Take consonants of your sentence: *lkhtdgs* (I **l**i**k**e **h**o**td**o**gs**).
2. Add the length of these consonants: *lkhtdgs7*.
3. Add first and last letter of website/service name: *lkhtdgs7Fk* (**F**aceboo**k**).

Tadaa! **lkhtdgs7Fk** would be your new Facebook password. Likewise, your password for Amazon would be **lkhtdgs7An**.

Passwords constructed this way will have these benefits:

* Easy to remember.
* Changes with each product/platform which make you invulnerable to situations like the Adobe hack.
* Tends to generate passwords that are very hard to crack/guess.
* Contain upper and lower case letters and numbers and with a fitting sentence they have a decent length  (10 characters or more). This ensures you won't be bit by the annoying "Your password must contain digits" form validation error.

For extra safety you can tweak the formula yourself. I've been using this for the last couple of weeks and it works really well.
